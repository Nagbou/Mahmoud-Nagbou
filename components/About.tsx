                <p>Hi, I'm Mahmoud</p>
                <p>
                    As a Business Intelligence Developer with extensive experience in web development, I am passionate about
                    harnessing data to drive strategic business decisions. I excel at transforming raw data into actionable
                    insights and thrive on solving complex problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My web development skills extend to designing and developing frontends from scratch, with a solid understanding of backend fundamentals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My focus is on innovation and leveraging technology to create impactful, data-driven strategies that
                    propel businesses forward.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to my formal education and degree in Business Intelligence, I am
                    a dedicated self-learner committed to continually expanding my expertise. Staying abreast of the latest
                    technologies and methodologies is crucial for mastering this ever-evolving field, and I am driven to
                    push the boundaries of what data can achieve.
                </p>
